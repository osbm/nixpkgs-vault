# anki-bin

## 📝 Description

Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it is a lot
more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly
decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from
Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and
scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless. For example:
learning a language, studying for medical and law exams, memorizing
people's names and faces, brushing up on geography, mastering long poems,
or even practicing guitar chords!
