# xwinwrap

## 📝 Description

XWinWrap is a small utility written a loooong time ago that allowed you to
stick most of the apps to your desktop background. What this meant was you
could use an animated screensaver (like glmatrix, electric sheep, etc) or
even a movie, and use it as your wallpaper. But only one version of this
app was ever released, and it had a few problems, like:

- Well, sticking didn’t work. So if you did a “minimize all” or “go to
desktop” kind of thing, your “wallpaper” got minimized as well.

- The geometry option didn’t work, so you could not create, e.g., a small
matrix window surrounded by your original wallpaper.

Seeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last
weekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features. And here
it is, in its new avatar “Shantz XWinWrap”.
