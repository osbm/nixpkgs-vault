# doomretro

## üìù Description

DOOM Retro is the classic, refined DOOM source port for Windows PC. It
represents how I like my DOOM to be today, in all its dark and gritty,
unapologetically pixelated glory. I have strived to craft a unique and
cohesive set of compelling features, while continuing to uphold my respect
for that classic, nostalgic DOOM experience many of us, after all this
time, still hold dear.

DOOM Retro has been under relentless, meticulous development since its
debut on December 10, 2013 commemorating DOOM's 20th anniversary, and it
has absolutely no intention of stopping. Its source code was originally
derived from Chocolate DOOM but is now very much its own beast. It does
include the usual, necessary enhancements that you'll find in all those
other DOOM source ports out there, but it also has many of its own cool,
original ideas that continues to set itself apart.

DOOM Retro is and always will be intentionally minimalistic in its
approach, and does a few things differently. It supports all vanilla,
limit removing, BOOM, MBF and MBF21-compatible maps and mods. In order to
freely implement certain features, and due to the nature of DOOM demos,
DOOM Retro does not support their recording or playback.

DOOM Retro is singleplayer only. Written in C, and released as free, open
source software under version 3 of the GNU General Public License, DOOM
Retro's 100,000 or so lines of code are diligently maintained in this
public Git repository and regularly compiled into both 32 and 64-bit
Windows apps using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022. Although next
to no support is provided, DOOM Retro's source code may also be compiled
and run under Linux and macOS.
