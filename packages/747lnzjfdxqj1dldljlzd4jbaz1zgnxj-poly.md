# poly

## 📝 Description

With short ascenders and a very high x-height, Poly is efficient in small
sizes. Thanks to its careful balance between the x-height and glyph widths,
it allows more economy and legibility than standard web serifs, even in
small sizes. The aglutinative language for which it was designed contains
very long words. The goal was to develop a typeface that would tolerate
cramped tracking and that would increase the number of letters on a single
line. Poly is a Unicode typeface family that supports Open Type features
and languages that use the Latin script and its variants.
