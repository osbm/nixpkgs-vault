# ondir

## 📝 Description

It works by executing scripts in directories when you enter and leave them.
This is done by overriding the shell builtins cd, pushd, and popd,
 which is a manual action.
The user is required to add a snippet to their shell initialisation file like .bashrc or .profile.

Which commands are executed on directory entry and leave is done
 in predefined locations with a .ondirrc file.

See man ondir for more information
