# gnomeExtensions.touchup

## 📝 Description

An extension for Gnome Shell that enhances the user experience for devices with a touchscreen – primarily focused (and tested) on tablets.

Current Features:
 - A system navigation bar (gesture or button mode)
 - Touch gestures for system notifications (dismiss, expand, …)
 - Make the system notification area touch-scrollable
 - Onscreen-Keyboard popups
 - A floating screen rotate button when auto-rotate is disabled

Each of these features can be enabled/disabled individually and most can be further customized in the extension settings.

A lot of additional features are planned – you can have a look at the repository for details on that. If you find bugs, have new ideas or would like to contribute, please open an issue on github so we can chat.

Please be aware that this extension is currently in beta status; a few bugs are known and more are expected – should you find any issues, please create an issue on github to let me know.
