# league-spartan

## 📝 Description

A new classic, this is a bold, modern, geometric sans-serif that has no
problem kicking its enemies in the chest.

Taking a strong influence from ATF's classic Spartan family, we're
starting our own family out with a single strong weight. We've put a few
unique touches into a beautiful, historical typeface, and made sure to
include an extensive characterset – currently totaling over 300 glyphs.

Over time, the open-source license will allow us expand League Spartan
into a full family, with multiple weights and styles, and we're starting
by releasing our first Bold style for this exciting, modern classic now.
