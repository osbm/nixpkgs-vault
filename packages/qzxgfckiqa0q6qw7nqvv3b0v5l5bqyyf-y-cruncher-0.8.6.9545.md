# y-cruncher

## 📝 Description

How fast can your computer compute Pi?

y-cruncher is a program that can compute Pi and other constants
to trillions of digits.

It is the first of its kind that is multi-threaded and scalable
to multi-core systems. Ever since its launch in 2009, it has
become a common benchmarking and stress-testing application for
overclockers and hardware enthusiasts.

y-cruncher has been used to set several world records for the
most digits of Pi ever computed.
