# raleway

## 📝 Description

Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was
expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida
in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics where added, and
most recently — a variable version.

It features both old style and lining numerals, standard and
discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as
a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces
than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

It also has a sister display family, Raleway Dots.
