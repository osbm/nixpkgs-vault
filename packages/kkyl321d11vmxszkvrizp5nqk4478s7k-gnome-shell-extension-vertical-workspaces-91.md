# gnomeExtensions.vertical-workspaces

## üìù Description

V-Shell is designed to enhance and customize the user experience by providing flexible workspace orientations and a variety of interface adjustments, including application grid customization and productivity improvements.

The "V" in V-Shell stands for "Variable," highlighting its adaptability to different user preferences.

V-Shell Features:
- Workspace Orientation: Switch between vertical or horizontal workspace layouts.
- Customizable Overview: Adjust layout, dimensions, and content of the GNOME overview.
- Alternative Overview Modes: Static workspace previews reduce unnecessary screen movement.
- Predefined Profiles: Four customizable profiles with different layouts and behaviors, easily replaceable with your own settings.
- Wallpaper Effects: Adjustable blur and brightness effects for the background in the overview.
- Dash Customization: Workspace isolation, control icon size, content, click, and scroll behavior.
- App Grid Adjustments: Modify dimensions, icon size, contents, and behavior of the app grid.
- Folder Preview: Display active icons in the app folder preview.
- Workspace Thumbnail Actions: Close workspace directly from its thumbnail.
- Panel Customization: Change the main panel's position and visibility.
- Hot Corner/Edge Behavior: Configure positions and actions for hot corners and edges.
- Notification Positioning: Adjust the placement of notifications, OSD, and workspace switcher popups.
- Window Attention Handling: Customize behavior for window attention requests.
- App Search Provider: Enhanced search with custom icon size options.
- Static Background in Switcher: Retain a static background during workspace switching outside the overview.
- Multi-Monitor Support: Independent workspace switching for each monitor (workaround).
- Gesture Workspace Switching: Show workspace switcher popup when switching workspaces with a gesture.
- Bug Fixes: Works around several known upstream bugs for a smoother experience.
- Modular Structure: Disable unnecessary modules or those that conflict with other extensions.

This version groups related features together, eliminates redundancy, and improves clarity while preserving the key points of the original list.

V-Shell includes many workarounds to survive conflicts and work with Dash to Dock / Ubuntu Dock extensions and other popular extensions, but issues may occur.
If you encounter any problem, first check for conflicts with other extensions and then open an issue on the Github page linked below.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
