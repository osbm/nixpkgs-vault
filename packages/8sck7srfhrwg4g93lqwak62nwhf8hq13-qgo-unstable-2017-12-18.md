# qgo

## 📝 Description

qGo is a Go Client based on Qt 5. It supports playing online at
IGS-compatible servers (including some special tweaks for WING and LGS,
also NNGS was reported to work) and locally against gnugo (or other
GTP-compliant engines). It also has rudimentary support for editing SGF
files and parital support for CyberORO/WBaduk, Tygem, Tom, and eWeiqi
(developers of these backends are currently inactive, everybody is welcome
to take them over).

Go is an ancient Chinese board game. It's called "圍棋(Wei Qi)" in
Chinese, "囲碁(Yi Go)" in Japanese, "바둑(Baduk)" in Korean.
