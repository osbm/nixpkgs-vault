# factorio-headless-experimental

## 📝 Description

Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories.

You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building
infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. Use your
imagination to design your factory, combine simple elements into
ingenious structures, apply management skills to keep it working and
finally protect it from the creatures who don't really like you.

Factorio has been in development since spring of 2012, and reached
version 1.0 in mid 2020.
